## 2025-07-27 Issue-7 Session 1: CI Failure Investigation and Fix

### Summary

This session focused on resolving a CI failure reported in issue #7. The investigation revealed that the `pnpm nx affected:lint` command in the CI workflow was not correctly identifying and linting files, leading to failures. The root cause appeared to be a misconfiguration or incompatibility with the Nx setup, as no `project.json` files were found to define Nx projects.

To resolve this, the CI workflow was modified to use a simpler, more direct `pnpm lint` command, which lints the entire codebase. This ensures all files are checked for linting errors, regardless of the Nx `affected` logic.

### Steps Taken

1.  **Issue Investigation**: Started by reviewing issue #7 and the linked failed GitHub Actions run.
2.  **CI Configuration Review**: Examined the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to identify the failing command (`pnpm nx affected:lint`).
3.  **Local Reproduction Attempts**: Attempted to reproduce the failure locally by running various `nx` and `lint` commands. These attempts were unsuccessful, suggesting the issue was specific to the CI environment or the `nx affected` logic.
4.  **Problem Identification**: Concluded that the use of `nx affected:lint` was unreliable in the current project structure due to the lack of `project.json` files.
5.  **Solution Implementation**: Modified the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file to replace `pnpm nx affected:lint` with `pnpm lint`.
6.  **Committing the Fix**: Committed the change to the CI configuration file with a descriptive commit message.
